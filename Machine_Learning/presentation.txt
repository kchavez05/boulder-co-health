For the machine learning selection process, we started with the average health inspection scores by facility. Again, we limited our dataset to health inspection scores prior to 2020 as we didn't want any pandemic variable to interfer with our analysis. Boulder County Health Department rates health inspection scores from Excellent to Unacceptable in 5 buckets. Our initial attempt at machine learning looked at predicting the Google rating (1 to 5) from the Health Scores (1 to 5). The initial machine learning results showed 59% accuracy. By creating a binary Google rating (Low to High) we increased the accuracy to 73%.

Next we wanted to figure out which of the violations contributed to the Google Ratings. Chi-squared was used to determine the relationship between the violations and the target value (Google rating). Along with the type of facility and the category of the facility, we analyzed all the violations in two ways - whether a facility had ever gotten a particular violation and the number of times a facility recieved a particular violation. Chi-squared helped identify 7 features to use in the machine learning model. Interesting, the violations most impactful on the Google rating dealt with water/sewage and toilets/handwashing. Which really enforces the restaurant age-old saying - if you want to know how clean a restaurant is, start in the bathroom.

The final step in selecting the machine learning model was to use the 7 features through 5 machine learning models and compare the accuracy scores. Logistic Regression was selected as our machine learning model, because of its simplicity and ability for probablistic predications. Even using a boosting algorithm did not increase the accuracy of predicting the Google Rating from the Health Inspection Scores and the most relevant violations.
